	php /e modifier
		If this deprecated modifier is set, preg_replace() does normal substitution of backreferences in the replacement string, evals it as PHP code(!!), and uses the result for replacing the search string.
		Deprecated since php5.5
		Backreferences
			=> A backslash followed by a digit greater than 0 is a back reference to a capturing subpattern earlier (i.e. to its left) in the pattern, provided there have been that many previous capturing left parentheses.
