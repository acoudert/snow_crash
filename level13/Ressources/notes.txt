RESOLUTION:
	ls -l
		=> -rwsr-sr-x 1 flag13 level13 7303 Aug 30  2015 level13
	./level13
		=> UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242
	id
		=> uid=2013(level13) gid=2013(level13) groups=2013(level13),100(users)
	=> My guess is we need to change our uid during program execution
	gdb level13
	disas main
		=> 2 getuid calls
	=> if we indeed need to set up our uid to get the flag
		=> Meaning we are using gdb
		=> Meaning the suid bit is useless
		=> Meaning the flag is probably hard coded
	Print memory zones
		x/s 0x80486c8
			=> 0x80486c8:	 "UID %d started us but we we expect %d\n"
		x/s 0x80486ef
			=> 0x80486ef:	 "boe]!ai0FB@.:|L6l@A?>qJ}I"
				=> Could be the encoded/encrypted flag
				=> Moreover the next line is:
					=> call   0x8048474 <ft_des>
						=> DES stands for Data Encryption Standard
		x/s 0x8048709
			=> 0x8048709:	 "your token is %s\n"
		I tried to decrypt the flag using a standard DES but it didnt work
			=> The DES function is altered
	Change UID
		b *main + 14
			=> Comparison following first getuid call
		i r eax
			=> eax            0x7dd	2013
		set var $eax=4242
		continue
			=> your token is 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx
	
	su flag13
		=> 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx
			=> su: Authentication failure
				=> level14 pw
	su level14
		=> 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx
			=> Works
