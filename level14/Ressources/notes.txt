I spent so much time trying to figure out what we had to do.
Nothing prove to be useful, from analyzing my everyrights on the system to analyzing the entire file system.
	=> Ended up using linpeas.sh to find out something
	=> Still nothing

Then I remembered level00 where I spent that much time
I remembered something that I tried that gave an unexpected result
	=> gdb /bin/getflag
		run
			=> You should not reverse this
The funny thing is that it was also present in level09 and I successfully reversed it

RESOLUTION:
	scp -P 4242 level14@192.168.1.23:/bin/getflag .
	bash script.sh
		=> Set up analyze as usual
		=> Then I saw so many interesting lines such as:
			=> fwrite("Check flag.Here is your token : ",1,0x20,stdout)
			=> pcVar4 = (char *)ft_des("H8B8h_20B4J43><8>\\ED<;j@3")
			=> pcVar4 = (char *)ft_des("bci`mC{)jxkn<\"uD~6%g7FK`7")
			=> pcVar4 = (char *)ft_des("8_Dw\"4#?+3i]q&;p6 gtw88EC")
				=> etc etc
		=> All of those lines are based on condition where getuid is checked
	gcc main.c
	cat /ect/passwd
		=> flag14:x:3014:3014::/home/flag/flag14:/bin/bash
			=> uid == 3014
	test with first found
		./a.out "H8B8h_20B4J43><8>\\ED<;j@3"
			=> wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
				=> Correct flag
			=> Checked: uid == 0xbbe == 3006 == flag06 uid
	Hex to dec:
		3014 == 0xbc6
	Corresponding encoded flag:
		=> "g <t61:|4_|!@IF.-62FH&G~DCK/Ekrvvdwz?v|"
	./a.out 'g <t61:|4_|!@IF.-62FH&G~DCK/Ekrvvdwz?v|'
		=> Check flag.Here is your token : 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ
